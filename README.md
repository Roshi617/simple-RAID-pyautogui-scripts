# simple-raid-pyautogui-scripts
Simple pyautogui scripts for Raid: Shadow Legends.



Can be used for Campaign battles or Dungeons.



Currently only available for screens that use 1360x768 and 1920x1080 resolution.



Requires game to be windowed and maximized. Xubuntu scripts account for the taskbar at the top of the screen. Old scripts account for the Windows taskbar at the bottom of the screen.



1920x1080 scripts require you to run them on the champions selection screen.



Use Ctrl+Z to stop the script.



## How to setup Python 3 for these scripts


Run "pip install pyautogui" without quotes in some kind of terminal (Command Prompt works). This will install the necessary dependencies needed to run my scripts.



On Linux, you need to also install tkinter. Run "sudo apt-get install python3-tk python3-dev" to do this, without quotes. I use Xubuntu, cannot help with Arch commands.
